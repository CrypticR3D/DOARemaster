GitHub Rules:
1. Please do NOT work on someone else's part. This means, anything inside their folder, any scene, any asset that is not yours. This is to assure there are no conflicts while merging anyone's work
2. Don't create any branches. If you have any branching issues, bring it to your Lead and it will be taken care of
