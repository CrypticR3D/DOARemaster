  docText: "Sunday 22nd 1971\r\n\r\nSean and I have met up a few times now. It\u2019s
    the usual place every time, The Grand Showroom Hotel. I am not sure why this
    place is out of all of them. It could be the large penthouse that we stay in
    (something I don\u2019t know how he can afford). But it just seems odd.\r\n\r\nThe
    staff must know what's going on. We come here together and leave together most
    nights. We clean the room of all our belongings each night to deter anyone from
    snooping.\r\n\r\n Does his wife not get concerned? I am not surprised if she
    isn\u2019t after hearing the stories that Sean tells me.\r\n"
