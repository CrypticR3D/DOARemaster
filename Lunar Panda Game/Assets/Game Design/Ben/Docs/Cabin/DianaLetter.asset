  docText: "Dear Sean,\r\n\r\nI am missing you dearly. I wish we could sort something
    out between us, instead of rushing to our secretive room in the hotel each time
    we want to meet. This relationship almost feels fake. I know you are married,
    but that woman doesn\u2019t treat you right. She moans and argues with you each
    day, I can see it in your face.\r\n\r\nI am not forcing you to do anything, but
    you should do what's right for you, I am always here, I will always listen. I
    will always love you\u2026\r\n\nLove Diana XX"
