    An incident was called into the
    home office. One Mrs Leah Ashford was attacked outside Ladlewood Woodlands. Conference
    between departments with local Rangers indicates that bear attacks in that area
    have recently been on the rise. She should have been aware of this.



    I
    started questioning Leah but her medical state stopped her from responding. Maybe
    Sean Ashford, her husband, knows more about why she was alone in such dangerous
    woods, but I am yet to get a response from him.



    I will soon contact him.
