  docText: "Friday 13th 1971:\r\n\r\nSean finally came to his senses and wanted to
    meet me at The Grand Showroom Hotel. He has been ignoring me for ages. Not a
    peep from him for 2 weeks. It\u2019s probably his wife that's been keeping him
    back. She is scaring him into not seeing other people. \r\n\r\nI do feel sorry
    for Sean. The amount of work he puts in a day to keep family luxuries paid for
    is immense. Yet his wife takes no notice of him. Not a single bit of appreciation.
    \r\n\r\nI am hoping that we can have a talk and sort out what has been going
    on\u2026\r\n\r\n"
