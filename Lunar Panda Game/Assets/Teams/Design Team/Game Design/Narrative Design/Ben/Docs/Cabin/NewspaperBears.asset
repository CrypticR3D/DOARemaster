  docText: "Rangers of Ladlewood have reported an increase in bear sightings. Some
    witnesses report close encounters with these vicious bears, they recommend staying
    far away.\r\n\nThis comes after a woman was attacked by a bear during their family
    hunting season trip.\r\n\nThe Rangers are currently investigating why bears have
    been spotted in these woods. One Ranger commented: \u201CIt\u2019s unusual, there
    haven\u2019t been bears spotted here for decades.\u201D\r\n\nThese woodlands
    are host to many tourists who come to relax but gain more of a following with
    their hunting season trips, where people all over the world come to explore these
    lands.\r\n\nRangers have warned those that travel through the area to avoid Ladlewood
    or report sightings to the closest Ranger Department\r\n"
