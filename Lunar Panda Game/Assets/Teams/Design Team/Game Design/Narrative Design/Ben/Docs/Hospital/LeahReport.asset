  docText: "Patient #9237-: Leah Ashford.\r\n\r\n16:45pm: Female aged 34 was found
    with wounds consistent with mauling from the claws of a bear. Major injuries.
    Bleeding was unstable.\r\n\r\n17:05: Law is informed of a possible attack on
    Leah. After careful examination, these Lacerations are consistent with other
    local bear attacks.\r\n\r\n17:20: Leah is in a critical state where her body
    is shutting down. The bleeding hasn\u2019t stopped. Morphine was injected to
    reduce the patient's pain. Another analysis will be conducted at 18:00.\r\n\r\n18:03:
    After another examination, we have concluded that the wounds are most likely
    going to be fatal.\r\n\r\n18:15: Next of kin (Mr Sean Ashford) was contacted.
    There was no response. Law has been informed.\r\n\r\n18:45: Leah has gone into
