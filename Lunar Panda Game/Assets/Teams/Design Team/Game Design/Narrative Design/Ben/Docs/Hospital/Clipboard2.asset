    16:45: Mr Gardener was
    found dead in an alleyway in the city. We are yet to examine the body for a means
    of death.

    

    17:30: The body was examined and the cause of death was
    believed to be blunt force head trauma. The item that caused this is yet unknown.
    However, there are odd protrusions in the body. We are going to take an X-Ray
    before we examine.
