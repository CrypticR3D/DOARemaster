  docText: "Monday 23rd 1971\r\n\r\nI got a call from Sean today. He sounded frantic
    and angry, wanting to meet up with me as soon as possible. He was almost shouting
    at me. It\u2019s odd because he mentioned that he was going on a trip soon with
    his family. Some sort of cabin out in the Ladlewood Woodlands. His parents owned
    it and would go out there for hunting season.\r\n\r\nHe finally met me in the
    hotel lobby. He had anger written all over his face. He was bright red in the
    face. Everyone looked at him as he stormed through the door, almost hitting the
    bellboy in the face. I was embarrassed, but I was glad that he was there. As
    usual, we went up to the room.\r\n"
