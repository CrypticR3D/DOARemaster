  docText: "Tuesday 24th 1971\r\n\r\nSomething was off last night. Apart from the
    angry phone call that I had with Sean, he was just distracted. He drank vast
    amounts of alcohol, more than he ever does. But that wasn\u2019t just it.\r\n\r\nSomeone
    slid a note under our room's door. Sean instantly stopped what he was doing and
    went over to it. From his face, he wasn't too pleased with what he was reading.\r\n\r\nWith
    no warning, he grabbed most of his clothes (he didn't even pick all of them up),
    slung them on and darted out the door. Not even saying goodbye. Just leave me
    here alone.\r\n\r\nI hope everything is ok. I don\u2019t want to ruin this relationship
    we have. I still love him. \r\n\r\n"
